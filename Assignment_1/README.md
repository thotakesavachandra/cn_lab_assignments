## Implentation Details
This assigment contains the implementation of the simple UDP client and server. Two sample files for testing the client and server are also provided (alphabets.txt and numbers.txt).
<br>
The client requests the content of the file from the server by sending the filename. The server reads the file and sends the content to the client. The client receives the content and writes it to a new file (writefile.txt).
