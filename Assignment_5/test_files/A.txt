2019-2020Foreword
T H E National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005,
recommends that children’s life at school must be linked
to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and
textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an
attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt
to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope
these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centered system of education outlined
in the National Policy of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that
school principals and teachers will take to encourage
children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate
new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook
as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons
why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school
routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily
time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing
the annual calendar so that the required number of
teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also
determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than
2019-2020a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology
and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities
requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and
Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by
the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
committee in languages, Professor Namwar Singh, and
the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli,
for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are
grateful to their principals for making this possible. We
are indebted to the institutions and organisations which
have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, materials and personnel. We are especially
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource
Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor
M rinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande for their
valuable time and contribution. As an organisation
committed to systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable
us to undertake further revision and refinements.

2019-2020General
Learning a language means using it for a wide variety of
purposes. Language is best acquired when attention is focused
on meaning, not on form.
Words and phrases not closely related to objects and action
remain empty and lifeless to young learners. Language comes
alive when presented in meaning-making contexts.
Words/phrases that are used to accomplish many useful
purposes follow a certain system inherent in the language itself.
Learners become familiar with the system through continuous
exposure to the language in meaning-focused situations.
Interaction, discussion and sharing of ideas among learners
provide opportunities that elicit ‘real’ information about them
and their experiences and opinions.
Encourage learners to work in pairs and small groups and let
them go beyond the textbook by providing a variety of
language inputs for spontaneous and natural use of language.
Build on the exercises given in the textbook and design more
tasks/activities in keeping with learners’ interests, needs and
surroundings. Employ free-response exercises (with more than
one possible response).
Promote reading habits through story reading (not merely
teaching stories as texts), story retelling, choral reading, shared
reading, etc.
Create class libraries for exchange of books and shared
reading. The library may also move with children to the next
higher class.
Poems need not be taught line by line, word by word. You may
give a model reading but let every child read the poem on her/his
own to feel the richness of language, rhythm and music of words.
Exercises accompanying the poem are more for understanding
the poem as a whole than for teaching language items.
Advertisement is also literary genre. You will find that some
advertisements have been given on the inner covers of the
textbook. Have a discussion in the class on these concerns. You
2019-2020may ask them to do a project on these social issues and concerns.
Such as educating the girlchild, environment protection.
Encourage learners to tell new stories, narrate anecdotes,
compose short poems in English or their own language, talk
about pictures, illustrations in the book and cartoons in
newspapers/magazines. Don’t get anxious about the errors they
will make. Constant exposure, practice and correction in the
form of feedback will help them improve themselves by and by.
Every page has a column for words and meanings. Encourage
children to write down other words they find difficult, along
with their meanings, in this column.
UNITS 1-3
The Best Christmas Present in the World
Some suggestions given below are applicable to all prose lessons
in the book.
A war story against the backdrop of Christmas, a festival
marked by family reunion, exchange of presents and universal
bonhomie. Connie, aged 101, receives a present from a stranger
whom she mistakes for her long-awaited husband. What is
the present — the letter or the mistaken identity of the visitor?
Spend about 20 minutes discussing the dates and events given
under Before you read. Since the answers are given later in the
book, the focus should be on the nature of each event — whether,
in human terms, the event recalls defeat and destruction or
endeavour and success. Let children express their own views.
Even if their observations do not reveal any understanding of
the nature of events, the discussion session will provide an
excellent base for initiating work on the story under reference.
The story is sectioned into three parts. Parts II and III may be
sectioned further according to convenience and time available.
Discuss each illustration with reference to the story.
Illustrations are given for better comprehension and sharper
visual appeal.

Comprehension Check at the end of each section is a recall of
what children have read so far. Design while-reading
comprehension exercises in the form of factual comprehension
questions, multiple choice questions and/or completion of
sentences, etc.
2019-2020Here is one example in three formats:
Factual or inferential comprehension (Answer the question
in your own words.)
Why is Jim ‘ashamed to say’ that Fritz ‘began it’?
Multiple choice (Mark the right answer.)
Jim is ‘ashamed to say’ that Fritz ‘began it’ because
(i) he didn’t know how to do it.
(ii) he wishes he had done it first.
(iii) he didn’t want to do it.
Sentence completion : (Choose the right item and complete
the sentence.)
But it is true, _______________, that Fritz began it.
(much to my delight / shame / dismay)
A related item here is the use of ‘begin’ and ‘start’ in appropriate
contexts.
Use ‘begin’ or ‘start’ appropriately in the following sentences.
(i) What time do you _________ work in the morning?
(ii) If we want to get there, we should ___________ now.
(iii) The film ___________ at 7 pm.
(iv) No matter how you try, the car won’t ___________.
Very often ‘begin’ and ‘start’ can be used in the same way,
though ‘start’ is more common in informal speech. [See
sentences (i) and (iii)]
In some constructions only ‘start’ can be used. [See
sentences (ii) and (iv)].
Questions under working with the text to be answered orally,
later to be written in the copy book.
At the end of the lesson, draw children’s attention to the two
quotations given in the box. Let them discuss how the story
illustrates the same ideas. Then, ask them to find sentences in
the story which appeal to them most. Here are some examples:
We agreed about everything and he was my enemy.
No one dies in a football match. No children are orphaned.
No wives become widows.
I know from all that happened today how much both armies
long for peace. We shall be together again, I’m sure of it. (It’s
a good example of the use of ‘irony’ in the story.)
Notes for the Teacher
2019-2020
3The Ant and the Cricket
Spend about 15 minutes eliciting, and listening to, fables or
fable-like stories from children, preferably in their own
language(s). Help them retell one or two in English by providing
appropriate words and phrases.
The story about the Sun and the Wind at the end of ‘Glimpses
of the Past’ may be used here. Ask them if it’s a fable, though
there are no animals in it.
Try the following writing task.
Rearrange the following sentences to construct a story. Start
with sentence 4.
1. One cold day, a hungry grasshopper came to the anthill
and begged for a little something to eat.
2. He replied, “Alas! I spent all my time singing and playing
and dancing, and never thought about winter.”
3. One ant asked him how he had spent his time during
summer and whether he had saved anything for winter.
4. A nest of ants had been occupied all through the summer
and autumn collecting food for winter.
5. They carefully stored it in the underground chambers of
their home.
6. Then we have nothing to give you.
7. Thus, when winter came, they had plenty to eat.
8. People who play and sing all summer should only dance
in winter.
9. The ant answered.
Find three adjectives in the first stanza associated with summer
and spring.
Find four phrases/lines in the same stanza associated with
the onset of winter.
Suppose the last line of the first stanza were to be rewritten as
‘Oh! What will become of me? Says the cricket.’ Would you
find it acceptable in the poem? If not, why not?
Speak the words given below. Ask children to write the word,
and against it two new words that rhyme.
4
Honeydew
2019-2020·
sing ____________ ___________
· crumb ____________ ___________
· through ____________ ___________
· wished ____________ ___________
(Last sound in ‘crumb’ is ‘m’. In ‘wished’ it is ‘t’.)
Activity 4 under working with language needs patience and
time. Punctuation in writing sentences is an important teaching
point. Since the activity is to be taken up in groups, there will
be several versions of each sentence to begin with. Encourage
children to discuss why only one version is grammatically
acceptable and not the other.
The Tsunami
A natural calamity causing huge destruction and loss of life
and property. Alongside the story of deep sorrow are reassuring
details of courage, survival and resilience.
While covering sections and sub sections of the text, focus on
situations in which children realise the importance of doing
whatever possible to save human and animal life, to participate
in relief work and to understand the concept of disaster
management.
Elicit their comments on, and reactions to, the stories of
Meghna and Almas. Focus on values such as courage, care
and compassion in the bitter struggle for survival and
rehabilitation.
The activity under Before you read is like an elementary
geography lesson. Map reading along with language work
(asking/answering questions, spotting location/ direction and
describing them with precision) is a good example of softening
subject boundaries and conforming to the idea of language
across the curriculum. Use other maps from the geography/
history textbook for further practice.
While dealing with ‘Active/Passive voice’ (working with
language: Activity 3), provide samples of texts exemplifying
the use of passive voice such as short newspaper reports and
descriptions of processes/experiments. As far as possible, avoid
a mechanical transformation exercise confined to isolated
sentences. Try a simple exercise given here.
Notes for the Teacher
2019-2020
5Complete the passage using passive forms of the verbs given
in brackets.
Olive oil ________ (use) for cooking, salad dressing, etc.
Olives_____ (pick) in autumn when they are ripe. They
______(shake) from the trees and ________ (gather) up, usually
by hand. Then they _______ (grind) to a thick paste which
_______ (spread) onto special mats. The mats then ______ (layer)
up on the pressing machine which will gently squeeze them to
produce olive oil.
The last activity under speaking and writing is a step towards
reducing the gap between children’s life at school and their
life outside the school.
Geography Lesson
Children already know words like ‘aeroplane, airport’, etc.
Draw their attention to words like ‘jetliner’, ‘jet engine’ and
‘jetlag’ in the following activity.
(i) Match items under A with those under B
A
B
Jetliner
• fatigue/tiredness after a long flight
Jetlag
• rich social group flying around the
world for business or pleasure
Jet engine
• aircraft powered by a jet engine
(the) jet set • engine that emits high-speed hot
gases at the back when it moves
forward.
(ii) Check the meaning of ‘jet black’ and ‘jetsam’ in the
dictionary. Complete the idiom : jetsam and _________
Today, if there is a border dispute or any other contentious
issue between two countries, an organisation called the United
Nations acts as a mediator to keep peace and order in the world.
Encourage children to gather information about the UN and its
constituent bodies.
Peace Memorial Park is the only park of its kind in the world.
It is in Hiroshima, Japan, and marks the spot where the first
atomic bomb was dropped on ___________ (Children will
remember the date and event if they recall the activity under
6
Honeydew
2019-2020Before you read in The Best Christmas Present in the World).
A mini project could be planned on this.
Ask children to draw a map of their locality/village depicting
its physical features and distances between places, etc.
Recite and write on the blackboard the following poem and
discuss the items given at the end of the poem.
Wake
gently this morning
to a different day.
Listen
There is no bray
of buses,
no horns blow.
There is only
the silence
of a city
hushed
with snow.
Name a few cities in India which the poem reminds you of.
Which words/phrases in the poem evoke images different from
those suggested by ‘the silence of the city’?
Glimpses of the Past
‘Glimpses’ of the history of our country to be understood
through pictures with strips of text for support. Children have
a natural enthusiasm for this kind of material in the textbook.
Children may read the comic strip aloud. Then they break up
into small groups, discuss what they have read and write a
summary. Each group presents its summary one by one. The
whole class then enters into a general discussion, and a
consolidated draft of the composition is prepared with the active
support of the teacher.
Conversely, divide the class into small groups. Let each group
look at and describe a set of pictures (assigned to them) and
construct their own text. Texts thus produced can be put
together to form a coherent story, to be edited for accuracy.
Notes for the Teacher
2019-2020
7If necessary, texts may first be produced in the child’s own
language and the teacher can help them to reformulate these
in English. For children fluent in English, this may be an
opportunity to formulate equivalent texts in their own
languages.
Some details of each ‘glimpse’ of the past may be had from the
history textbook of the same class. The history teacher may
be invited to facilitate the activity.
Picture reading under speaking and writing to be attempted
in the same manner.
Creating a comic (Activity 5) will be great fun if children can be
persuaded to draw/learn to draw matchstick figures. Enlist
the help of the art teacher.
Macavity – The Mystery Cat
Have you ever wondered why people generally communicate
with their pet dog mainly in English?
What would you say to persuade your cat to leave the mouse
alone? Try to say it in English.
Which sentence about Macavity has been repeated four times
in the poem? Why has it been repeated? Think about it.
Mention a couple of ‘crimes’ discovered in the kitchen, and
your Macavity was nowhere to be seen.
a fiend in feline shape
Does it remind you of a similar expression about a wolf? What
is it, and what does it mean?
Here are four lines about someone’s cat. Read them and say
whether it is a mystery cat.
My kitten walks on velvet feet
And makes no sound at all.
And in the doorway nightly sits
To watch the darkness fall.

2019-2020Before you read
There are some dates or periods of time in the history
of the world that are so significant that everyone
knows and remembers them. The story you will read
mentions one such date and event: a war between
the British and the Germans in 1914. Can you guess
which war it was?
Do you know which events the dates below refer to?
(a) 4 July 1776
(b) 17 December 1903
(c) 6 August 1945
(d) 30 January 1948
(e) 12 April 1961
(f) 20 July 1969
The answers are on page 23.
I
I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk.
The man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak.
I had wanted one, but they were far too expensive. This
one was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces,
one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one
side. It was going for very little money. I thought I could
restore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to
have it. I paid the man and brought it back to my
workroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it
on Christmas Eve.
I removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the
drawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere — it

looked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had
clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was
stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the
end I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of
my fist and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space
underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in
there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box.
Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper,
and written on it in shaky
handwriting: “Jim’s
last letter, received
January 25, 1915.
To be buried with
me when the
time comes.” I
knew as I did
it that it was
wrong of me to
open the box,
but curiosity
got the better of
my scruples. It
usually does.
Inside the box there was an envelope. The address
read: “Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport,
Dorset.” I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written
in pencil and dated at the top — “December 26, 1914”.

Dearest Connie,
I write to you in a much happier frame of mind because
something wonderful has just happened that I must tell
2019-2020you about at once. We were all standing to in our trenches
yesterday morning, Christmas morning. It was crisp and
quiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I’ve ever seen, as
cold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be.
I should like to be able to tell you that we began it.
But the truth, I’m ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it.
First someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches
opposite. Then they were calling out to us from across
no man’s land, “Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy
Christmas!” When we had got over the surprise, some of
us shouted back, “Same to you, Fritz! Same to you!” I
thought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly
one of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving
a white flag. “Don’t shoot, lads!” someone shouted. And
no one did. Then there was another Fritz up on the
parapet, and another. “Keep your heads down,” I told the
men, “it’s a trick.” But it wasn’t.
One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his
head. “It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps.
We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?” By this time there
were dozens of them walking towards us across no man’s
land and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris
was the first up. “Come on, boys. What are we waiting
for?” And then there was no stopping them. I was the
officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I
suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to
me I should. All along their line and ours I could see
men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats,
khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of
them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we
were making peace.
You cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as
I looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached
me, hand outstretched. “Hans Wolf,” he said, gripping
my hand warmly and holding it. “I am from Dusseldorf.
I play the cello in the orchestra. Happy Christmas.”

“Captain Jim Macpherson,” I replied. “And a Happy
Christmas to you too. I’m a school teacher from Dorset,
in the west of England.”
“Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it
very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent
sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke
almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had
never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England.
He had learned all he knew of England from school,
and from reading books in English. His favourite writer
was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the
Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked
of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and
Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months
ago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki
and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking,
laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I
shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake,
Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had
ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and
he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party
like it, Connie.
Then someone, I don’t know who, brought out a
football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make
goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy
against Fritz out in the middle of no man’s land. Hans
Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands
and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as
anything. There was a moment when I noticed our
breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too
and smiled. “Jim Macpherson,” he said after a while,
“I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football
match. No one dies in a football match. No children are
orphaned. No wives become widows.”
“I’d prefer cricket,” I told him. “Then we Tommies
could be sure of winning, probably.” We laughed at
that, and together we watched the game. Sad to say,
Honeydew
2019-2020Connie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf
generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it
wasn’t quite fair.
The time came, and all too soon, when the game was
finished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage
had long since run out, and we knew it was all over.
I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see
his family again soon, that the fighting would end and
we could all go home.
“I think that is what every soldier wants, on both
sides,” Hans Wolf said. “Take care, Jim Macpherson.
I shall never forget this moment, nor you.” He saluted
and walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt.
He turned to wave just once and then became one of
the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards
their trenches.
That night, back in our dugouts, we heard them
singing a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was
Stille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing
chorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged
carols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had
our time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as
long as I live.

I folded the letter again and slipped it carefully back
into its envelope. I kept awake all night. By morning I
knew what I had to do. I drove into Bridport, just a few
miles away. I asked a boy walking his dog where Copper
Beeches was. House number 12 turned out to be nothing
but a burned-out shell, the roof gaping, the windows
boarded-up. I knocked at the house next door and asked
if anyone knew the whereabouts of a Mrs Macpherson.
Oh yes, said the old man in his slippers, he knew her
well. A lovely old lady, he told me, a bit muddle-headed,
but at her age she was entitled to be, wasn’t she? A
hundred and one years old. She had been in the house
when it caught fire. No one really knew how the fire had
started, but it could well have been candles. She used
candles rather than electricity, because she always
thought electricity was too expensive. The fireman had
got her out just in time. She was in a nursing home
now, he told me, Burlington House, on the Dorchester
road, on the other side of town.

I found Burlington House Nursing Home easily enough.
There were paper chains up in the hallway and a lighted
Christmas tree stood in the corner with a lopsided angel
on top. I said I was a friend come to visit Mrs Macpherson
to bring her a Christmas present. I could see through
into the dining room where everyone was wearing a paper
hat and singing. The matron had a hat on too and
seemed happy enough to see me. She even offered me a
mince pie. She walked me along the corridor.
“Mrs Macpherson is not in with the others,” she told
me. “She’s rather confused today so we thought it best
if she had a good rest. She has no family you know, no
one visits. So I’m sure she’ll be only too pleased to see
you.” She took me into a conservatory with wicker chairs
and potted plants all around and left me.
The old lady was sitting in a wheelchair, her hands
folded in her lap. She had silver white hair pinned into a
wispy bun. She was gazing out at
the garden. “Hello,” I said. She
turned and looked up at me
vacantly. “Happy Christmas,
Connie,” I went on. “I found
this. I think it’s yours.” As I was
speaking her eyes never left my
face. I opened the tin box and
gave it to her. That was the
moment her eyes lit up with
recognition and her face
became suffused with a sudden
glow of happiness. I explained
about the desk, about how I
had found it, but I don't think

Suddenly she reached out and took my hand. Her

by Christmas, dearest,” she said. “And here you are,
the best Christmas present in the world. Come closer,
Jim dear, sit down.”
I sat down beside her, and she kissed my cheek. “I
read your letter so often Jim, every day. I wanted to
hear your voice in my head. It always made me feel you
were with me. And now you are. Now you’re back you
can read it to me yourself. Would you do that for me,
Jim dear? I just want to hear your voice again. I’d love
that so much. And then perhaps we’ll have some tea.

2019-2020A fable is a story, often with animals as characters, that conveys
a moral. This poem about an ant and a cricket contains an idea
of far-reaching significance, which is as true of a four-legged
cricket as of a ‘two-legged one’. Surely, you have seen a cricket
that has two legs!
A silly young cricket, accustomed to sing
Through the warm, sunny months of gay summer and spring,
Began to complain when he found that, at home,
His cupboard was empty, and winter was come.
Not a crumb to be found
On the snow-covered ground;
Not a flower could he see,
Not a leaf on a tree.
“Oh! what will become,” says the cricket, “of me?”
At last by starvation and famine made bold,
All dripping with wet, and all trembling with cold,
Away he set off to a miserly ant,
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant
Him shelter from rain,
And a mouthful of grain.
He wished only to borrow;
He’d repay it tomorrow;
If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.
2019-2020Says the ant to the
cricket, “I’m your servant
and friend,
But we ants never
borrow; we ants never
lend.
But tell me, dear cricket,
did you lay nothing by
When the weather was
warm?” Quoth the cricket,
“Not I!
My heart was so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay.”
“You sang, Sir, you say?
Go then,” says the ant, “and dance the winter away.”
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket,
And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Folks call this a fable. I’ll warrant it true:
Some crickets have four legs, and some have two.

accustomed to sing: used to singing; in the habit of singing

Tilly Smith (a British school girl) was able to save many
lives when the tsunami struck Phuket beach in Thailand.
Though she has won a number of awards, her parents
have not allowed their daughter to be interviewed on
television and made into a heroine. Why do you think they
took that decision?
Now here is a story from Thailand.
The Smith family from South-East England were
celebrating Christmas at a beach resort in southern
Thailand. Tilly Smith was a ten-year-old schoolgirl; her
sister was seven years old. Their parents were Penny
and Colin Smith.
It was 26 December 2004. Deadly tsunami waves
were already on their way. They had been triggered
by a massive earthquake off northern Sumatra earlier
that morning.
“The water was swelling and kept coming in,” Penny
Smith remembered. “The beach was getting smaller and
smaller. I didn’t know what was happening.”

But Tilly Smith sensed that something was wrong.
Her mind kept going back to a geography lesson she
had taken in England just two weeks before she flew
out to Thailand with her family.
Tilly saw the sea slowly rise, and start to foam, bubble
and form whirlpools. She remembered that she had seen
this in class in a video of a tsunami that had hit the
Hawaiian islands in 1946. Her geography teacher had
shown her class the video, and told them that tsunamis
can be caused by earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.
Tilly started to scream at her family to get off the
beach. “She talked about an earthquake under the sea.
She got more and more hysterical,” said her mother
Penny. “I didn’t know what a tsunami was. But seeing
my daughter so frightened, I thought something serious
must be going on.”
Tilly’s parents took her and her sister away from the
beach, to the swimming pool at the hotel. A number of
other tourists also left the beach with them. “Then it
was as if the entire sea had come out after them. I was
screaming, ‘Run!’”
The family took refuge in the third floor of the hotel.
The building withstood the surge of three tsunami waves.
If they had stayed on the beach, they would not have
been alive.
The Smiths later met other tourists who had lost
entire families. Thanks to Tilly and her geography lesson,
they had been forewarned. Tilly went back to her school
in England and told her classmates her terrifying tale.

Look carefully at the picture of the boy and his dog, and

calm, blue sea …. ruined huts………
Before the giant waves slammed into the coast in
India and Sri Lanka, wild and domestic animals seemed
to know what was about to happen. They fled to safety.
According to eyewitness accounts, elephants screamed
and ran for higher ground; dogs refused to go outdoors;
flamingoes abandoned their low-lying breeding areas;
and zoo animals rushed into their shelters and could
not be enticed to come back out.
Many people believe that animals possess a sixth
sense and know when the earth is going to shake. Some
experts believe that animals’ more acute hearing helps
them to hear or feel the earth’s vibration. They can sense
an approaching disaster long before humans realise
what’s going on.
We cannot be sure whether animals have a sixth
sense or not. But the fact is that the giant waves that
rolled through the Indian Ocean killed more than
150,000 people in a dozen countries; but not many
animals have been reported dead.
Along India’s Cuddalore coast, where thousands of
people perished, buffaloes, goats and dogs were found
unharmed. The Yala National Park in Sri Lanka is home
to a variety of animals including elephants, leopards,
and 130 species of birds. Sixty visitors were washed
away from the Patanangala beach inside the park; but

2019-2020
29no animal carcasses were found, except for two water
buffaloes. About an hour before the tsunami hit, people
at Yala National Park had observed three elephants
running away from the Patanangala beach.
A Sri Lankan gentleman who lives on the coast near
Galle said his two dogs would not go for their daily run
on the beach. “They are usually excited to go on this
outing,” he said. But on that day they refused to go,
and most probably saved his life.

33Can you imagine what your city would look like if you saw it
from ten thousand feet above the ground? Neatly planned and
perfect in proportion like a geometric design, it would strike you
as something very different from what it actually is while you
are in the thick of it.
Here is a poet's description of just such a view of the city, and
some questions that come to his mind.
When the jet sprang into the sky,
it was clear why the city
had developed the way it had,
seeing it scaled six inches to the mile.
There seemed an inevitability
about what on ground had looked haphazard,
unplanned and without style
When the jet sprang into the sky.
When the jet reached ten thousand feet,
it was clear why the country
had cities where the rivers ran
and why the valleys were populated.
The logic of geography —
that land and water attracted man —
was clearly delineated
When the jet reached ten thousand feet.
When the jet rose six miles high,
it was clear the earth was round
and that it had more sea than land.
2019-2020But it was difficult to understand
that the men on the earth found
causes to hate each other, to build
walls across cities and to kill.
From that height, it was not clear why.

Here are some pictorial glimpses of the history of our
country from 1757 to 1857. These pictures and
‘speech bubbles’ will help clarify your understanding
of the conditions that led to the event known as the
First War of Independence in 1857.
1. The Martyrs
At a function in Delhi
Oh my countrymen!
Let your eyes fill with tears,
as you recall the sacrifices of
India’s martyrs.
2019-20202. The Company’s conquests (1757-1849)
With its superior weapons, the British
East India Company was extending its
power in 18th century India.
Indian princes were short-sighted.
That upstart Rajah
Bah! Call the English
merchants. They will
help me to defeat him.

The people had no peace due to such constant fights.
The rivalries helped the East India Company
and it could easily subdue Indian princes
one by one.
Thank God, there is peace
in the country now! No
more wars and no looting
by thugs !
How did Indians react to these conquests?
Our destiny
is linked
with them!
The white man has
killed or dethroned
our kings.
A far-seeing ruler like the
brave Tipu of Mysore

373. British Rule (1765-1836)
Religious leaders preached ideas like untouchability and child marriage.
Anyone who crosses the
seas loses his religion.
All the misery in the
world is due to women.
The truth was that Indians had lost self-respect.
The British scorned them.
Being merchants, the British wanted quick profits, their
heavy taxes forced farmers to abandon their fields.
But your men are
taking all my crop!
You are still in
arrears. If you don’t
pay next week. I will
send you to jail.
The natives are
unworthy of trust,
incapable of
honesty–
True, your honour,
but I am honest.
Inevitably famines followed. Between 1822 and
1836 fifteen lakh Indians died of starvation.
Still, the British invented other methods
which gave them more profits.
The British policies
ruined the expert
artisans and their
business.
The goods manufactured
in England should not
have any import duty
when brought into India.
A good
idea!
The East India Company’s
laws began to cripple
Indian industries.

2019-20204. Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833)
Ram Mohan Roy, a learned man from Bengal,
understood what was wrong with the country.
He told his wife Uma–
Cows are of different colours, but
the colour of their milk is the
same. Different teachers have
different opinions but the essence
of every religion is the same.
Let us not despise ourselves, our ancient culture is
great. And we are capable of greater achievements.
We must first reform our society.
Superstitions have been
ruining us.
He was attracted by
science and modern
knowledge.
Knowledge should
be practical and
scientific.
He crossed the seas and
went to England to see what
made the British powerful.
There he told them–
We accept you as rulers,
and you must accept us
as subjects. But you
must remember the
responsibility a ruler
owes to his subjects.
He started
newspapers but
the suspicious
British stopped
them in 1823.

395. Oppression (1765-1835)
But the British continued to oppress Indians. In
1818, they had passed Regulation III. Under it, an
Indian could be jailed without trial in a court.
All the time British officers in India
drew big salaries and also made
fortunes in private business.
By 1829, Britain was
exporting British goods
worth seven crore
rupees to India.
Governor-General Bentinck reported
back home –
“The bones of cotton weavers are bleaching
the plains of India.”

The British prospered on
the Company’s loot
while Indian industries
began to die.6. Dissatisfaction (1835-56)
Education in India was in Persian and
Sanskrit. In 1835, a Englishman named
Macaulay suggested a change.
English education produced clerks to whom the British gave petty
jobs under them. Incidentally, it also produced a new generation
of intellectuals.
We must
educate our
brothers.
We should teach the
natives through the
English language.
And try to
improve their
material
conditions.
For that we must
convey our grievances
to the British
Parliament.
I agree.
By 1856, the
British had
conquered the
whole of India.
They cared little about the needs of Indians.

Taxes continued to ruin the peasants. In
Bengal, the Santhals who had lost their lands
under new land rules, became desperate. In
1855, they rose in rebellion and massacred
Europeans and their supporters alike.
Discontent was brewing in the East India Company’s army too.

History becomes fun at this school
Mumbai: Students in the sixth grade of a certain school in Navi Mumbai love
their history lessons thanks to a novel teaching aid. It is not surprising given
the fact that their study material includes comic books and they use their
textbooks for reference to put things into perspective. Besides, students are
encouraged to tap other sources of information as well. During history classes,
students pore over comic strips of historical periods, enact characters of
emperors and tyrants, and have animated discussions on the subject. History
has become fun.
In the class students are asked to read the comic strip aloud, after which
they break up into groups of four, discuss what they have heard and write a
summary. Each group leader reads his group's summary aloud and the
whole class jumps into discussion and debate, adding points, disagreeing
and qualifying points of view. A sixth grade student says, “It’s a lot of fun
because everyone gets a chance to express themselves and the summary
takes everyone's ideas into account.”
According to the school principal the comic strip format and visuals appeal
to students. A historian feels that using comics in schools is a great idea.
Comics and acting help students understand what characters in the story
are actually thinking.
(adapted from The Times of India, New Delhi, October 2007)
Based on this news item, write a paragraph on what you think about this
new method of teaching history.
4. Find the chapters in your history book that correspond to the episodes and
events described in this comic. Note how the information contained in a few
chapters of history has been condensed to a few pages with the help of pictures
and ‘speech bubbles’.
5. Create a comic of your own using this story.
Once the Sun and the Wind began to quarrel, each one saying that he
was stronger than the other. At last they decided to test each other’s
strength. A man with a cloak around his shoulders was passing by.
The Wind boasted, “Using my strength I can make that man take off
the cloak.” The Sun agreed. The Wind blew hard. The man felt so cold
that he clasped his cloak round his body as tightly as possible.
Now it was the turn of the Sun which shone very hot indeed. The
man felt so hot that he at once removed the cloak from his body.
Seeing the man taking off the cloak, the Wind conceded defeat.

Do you have a pet cat? Have you ever noticed anything
mysterious about it? It is not easy to say whether every cat is a
mystery, but Macavity is one, for sure. What is it that makes
him a perfect mystery cat? Read the poem and find out.
Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden
Paw —
For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s
despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s
not there!
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like
Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks
the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir
stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime
— Macavity’s not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you
may look up in the air —
But I tell you once and once again,
Macavity’s not there!
Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and
thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for
his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his
head is highly domed;
2019-2020His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements
like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in
the square —
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!
T.S. ELIOT
defy: disobey or resist openly
Scotland Yard: the headquarters of the London police force

Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory
A Satyajit Ray story with a surprise ending that brings in its wake
the much needed psychological relief to the sophisticated executive
beleagured by a conspiracy, which is a humorous take after all.
Before asking children to read the text, tell the story part by part,
each part ending where the listener wonders what comes next.
Activity 3 under working with language is about two tense
forms — simple past and present perfect. Notice how both
have been used in conjunction with each other. The following
explanatory notes may be useful.
• The present perfect tense is used to refer to an action
initiated and completed in the past and is associated with
the present. It has its effect on the present situation.
I have seen the Taj. (I know what it looks like.)
He has arrived. (He is here.)
I have finished my work. (I am free now.)
Present perfect tense is usual with already, so far,not yet, ever,
never etc.
It is not used with ago, yesterday, last week/month/year, etc.
The Last Bargain
Here is a method of teaching that may be tried.
(a) Let children read the first stanza silently.
Ask the following questions.
(i) How many persons/characters are there?

I was walking on the road looking for work. I saw the king in
his chariot. He had a sword in his hand. He was very kind to
me. He shook my hand and offered to hire me. I did not
accept his offer. To me, power is not a valuable thing. It is not
permanent. It won’t make me happy. I was looking for
something else as a reward for my work.
What is he looking for?
Let us read the next stanza.
(c) Do the other stanzas in the same way.
The clue to what the person is looking for lies in the last line.
The operative phrases are ‘the child’s play’ and ‘a free man’.
The child and her/his play is a metaphor for innocence and inward
happiness, which gives this person a sense of fulfilment and
freedom from stress and strife. He feels genuinely free and happy
in the company of the child.
Recite each stanza with feeling, pausing at the right places.
The method suggested may work better for a poem with a story.
The Summit Within
Adventure and the world of nature – the arduous task of
reaching the highest summit in the world makes the climber
reflect on the ‘internal summits’ which are, perhaps, higher
than the Everest. The text underscores the physical, emotional
and spiritual aspects of the adventure in a single perspective.
Divide the text into three parts. A convenient division is
suggested here.
‘...............that mountains are a means of communion with
God’. (end of Part-I)
‘It is emotional. It is spiritual’. (end of Part-II)
The remaining is Part-III.
Design while-reading comprehension questions for each part.
The multiple choice items are given at the end of the lesson. You
may try the following as additional questions.
What is the author’s personal answer to the question as to
why people climb mountains?
How is the same question answered in Part-II in a different way?

The School Boy
A school is a place where children and teachers assemble every
morning to learn from one another. Find out if any child would
like to describe school in a different way.
An interesting discussion on different types of schools,
supported by pictures from magazines/newspapers, may
ensue — a village school where children are sitting on the floor;
another school where they are sitting at long desks; an outdoor
lesson under a tree, etc.
Ask children how they reach school. Do they walk or take a
bus, etc.? What problems others in remote areas may face in
reaching school on time?
Any suggestions as to how to make school an interesting and
enjoyable place!

55This is Jody’s Fawn
A story about a child’s emotional preoccupation with the fawn
whose mother had to be killed to save his father’s life. The
story highlights values such as compassion and justice, care
and concern for human and animal life.
Spend some time on a discussion about ‘home remedies’ for
commonplace health problems/ailments. Should we see a
doctor about every little thing, or should we talk to the
grandmother first?
The growing concern about preservation of environment and
protection of animal life has gone a long way in persuading schools
to refrain from dissecting animals for experiment. Elicit children’s
comments on the issue and on the law that punishes humans
for hurting animals.
Activity 1 under working with language is about reporting
questions – yes/no and wh-questions. The use of ‘if/whether’
in the case of yes/no type questions should be explicitly
explained. Devise separate exercises for teaching the use of
‘if/whether’, the appropriate reporting verb, the changes in
pronominals in the reported speech and the sequence of tenses.
Here is a simple exercise to exemplify some of these points.
Choose the correct word to complete statements in indirect speech
given below. Write words in the blanks given.
(a) “Where do you come from?”
I ___________(said/asked) him where ______________ (he/
you) come from.
(b) “What is your name?”
He asked me what ____________ (my/his) name. (is/was)
(c) “Are you happy?”
I asked him ______________ (if/whether) he _____________
(is/was) happy.
(d) “Do you live here?”
56 Honeydew
He asked me ___________ (whether/if) I ____________ (live/
lived) ___________ (here/there).
(e) “Why are you crying?”
The teacher asked the child ______________ (if/why) she
_____ (is/was/were) crying.
2019-2020Here is another exercise.
Read the following dialogue between Jody and his father. Rewrite
their conversation in indirect speech.
Penny lay quiet, staring at the ceiling.
“Boy, you’ve got me hemmed in.”
“It won’t take much to raise the fawn.
It will soon start eating leaves.”
“You are smarter than boys of your age.”
“We took its mother, and it wasn’t to blame.”
“It seems ungrateful to leave it to starve.”
Begin like this:
Penny lay quiet staring at the ceiling. He said to Jody that

Activity 2 under working with language deals with transitive
and intransitive verbs.
Ask children to underline the direct object in the following
sentences.
He brought me a colourful umbrella.
I will write a letter to him.
You should give yourself a chance.
Activity 3 under writing may be linked with the first task
covering home remedies under ‘Before you read,’ It will be
useful to take it up separately also.
A Visit to Cambridge
Excerpt from a travelogue highlighting exchange of views
between two extraordinary persons on what it means to be
‘differently abled’. A tour through Cambridge had a surprise,
both pleasant and poignant, for the author. He met the brilliant
and completely paralysed author of A Brief History of Time,
and talked to him for a full half-hour.
Activity 2 under working with language is about the present
participle (dancing/walking) used as adjective.
Running on the road, he saw __________. (participle)
The train is running. __________ (verb)
Notes for the Teacher

The use of past participle as adjective may also be illustrated
here.
He has broken the window. (verb)
The window was broken when the almirah was taken out
(verb — in passive)
See the broken window. (adjective)
Activity 3 under speaking and writing may be done as a project.
Lot of oral work to precede the writing task. The final draft should
be edited and improved before it is put up on the board.
Activities 1 and 2 under speaking and writing are about word
stress. Stressed syllables to be pronounced clearly and loudly.
Some words of more than one syllable from the text may also be
listed according to whether the stress falls on the first or the
second syllable.
When I Set Out for Lyonnesse
The poem has a clear beginning-middle-end structure. The
beginning is ‘setting out’, the middle is ‘sojourn’ and the end
is ‘return’.
Draw children’s attention to appropriate words/phrases/lines
that suggest and reinforce each phase of the journey.
‘Lyonnesse’ to be pronounced as lie-an-ness. The last syllable
receives the primary stress.
If feasible and useful, explain the rhyme scheme and its musical

2019-2020Before you read
Do you have a good memory? Has your memory ever
played any tricks on you?
Forgetfulness often puts you in a tight spot. But forgetting
a part of your life completely may drive you crazy. In this
story, Bepin Babu goes nearly crazy because he cannot
recollect his stay at Ranchi. He has never been to Ranchi,
he insists, though there are many witnesses to the
contrary. What is the suspense all about?
I
Every Monday, on his way back from work, Bepin
Choudhury would drop in at Kalicharan's in New Market
to buy books. Crime stories, ghost stories and thrillers.
He had to buy at least five at a time to last him through
the week. He lived alone, was not a good mixer, had few
friends, and didn’t like spending time in idle chat. Today,
at Kalicharan’s, Bepin Babu had the feeling that
someone was observing him from close quarters. He
turned round and found himself looking at a round
faced, meek looking man who now broke into a smile.
“I don’t suppose you recognise me.”
“Have we met before?” asked Bepin Babu.
The man looked greatly surprised. “We met every day for a
whole week. I arranged for a car to take you to the Hudroo falls.

“Ranchi?”
Now Bepin Babu realised that it was not he but this
man who was making a mistake. Bepin Babu had never
been to Ranchi. He had been at the point of going several
times, but never made it. He smiled and said, “Do you
know who I am?”
The man raised his eyebrows, bit his tongue and
said, “Do I know you? Who doesn’t know Bepin
Choudhury?”
Bepin Babu now turned towards the bookshelves and
said, “Still you’re making a mistake. One often does.
I’ve never been to Ranchi.”
The man now laughed aloud.
“What are you saying, Mr Choudhury? You had a
fall in Hudroo and cut your right knee. I brought you
iodine. I had fixed up a car for you to go to Netarhat the
next day, but you couldn’t because of the pain in the
knee. Can’t you recall anything? Someone else you know
was also in Ranchi at that time. Mr Dinesh Mukerji.
You stayed in a bungalow. You said you didn’t like hotel
food and would prefer to have your meals cooked by a
6 0 Honeydew
2019-2020bawarchi. Mr Mukerji stayed with his sister. You had a
big argument about the moon landing, remember? I’ll
tell you more: you always carried a bag with your books
in it on your sight-seeing trips. Am I right or not?”
Bepin Babu spoke quietly, his eyes still on the books.
“Which month in ’58 are you talking about?”
The man said, “October.”
“No, sir,” said Bepin Babu. “I spent Puja in ’58 with
a friend in Kanpur. You’re making a mistake. Good day.”
But the man didn’t go, nor did he stop talking.
“Very strange. One evening I had tea with you in a
veranda of your bungalow. You spoke about your family.
You said you had no children, and that you had lost
your wife ten years ago. Your only brother had died
insane, which is why you didn’t want to visit the mental
hospital in Ranchi...”
When Bepin Babu had paid for the books and was
leaving the shop, the man was still looking at him in
utter disbelief.

II
Bepin Babu’s car was safely parked in Bertram Street
by the Lighthouse Cinema. He told the driver as he got
into the car, “Just drive by the Ganga, will you, Sitaram.”
Driving up the Strand Road, Bepin Babu regretted
having paid so much attention to the intruder. He had
never been to Ranchi — no question about it. It was
inconceivable that he should forget such an incident
which took place only six or seven years ago. He had an
excellent memory. Unless — Bepin Babu’s head reeled.

Was he losing his mind? But how could that be? He
was working daily in his office. It was a big firm, and he
was doing a responsible job. He wasn’t aware of anything
ever going seriously wrong. Only today he spoke for
half an hour at an important meeting. And yet...
And yet the man knew a great deal about him. How?
He even seemed to know some intimate details. The bag
of books, wife’s death, brother’s insanity... The only
mistake was about his having gone to Ranchi. Not a
mistake; a deliberate lie. In ’58, during the Pujas, he
was in Kanpur at his friend Haridas Bagchi’s place.
All Bepin Babu had to do was write to — no, there was
no way of writing to Haridas. Bepin Babu suddenly
remembered that Haridas had left with his wife for Japan
some weeks ago, and he didn’t have his address.
But where was the need for proof? He himself was
fully aware that he hadn’t been to Ranchi — and that
was that.
The river breeze was bracing, and yet a slight
discomfort lingered in Bepin Babu’s mind.
Around Hastings, Bepin Babu decided to roll up his
trousers and take a look at his right knee.
There was the mark of an old inch-long cut. It was
impossible to tell when the injury had occurred.
62 Honeydew
2019-2020Had he never had a fall as a boy and cut his knee? He
tried to recall such an incident, but couldn’t.
Then Bepin Babu suddenly thought of Dinesh
Mukerji. The man had said that Dinesh was in Ranchi
at the same time. The best thing surely would be to ask
him. He lived quite near — in Beninandan Street. What
about going right now? But then, if he had really never
been to Ranchi, what would Dinesh think if Bepin Babu
asked for a confirmation? He would probably conclude
Bepin Babu was going nuts. No; it would be ridiculous
to ask him.
And he knew how ruthless Dinesh’s sarcasm
could be.
Sipping a cold drink in his air-conditioned living
room, Bepin Babu felt at ease again. Such a nuisance!
Just because they have nothing else to do, they go about
getting into other people’s hair.
A fter dinner, snuggling in bed with one of the new
thrillers, Bepin Babu forgot all about the man in New
Market.
Next day, in the office, Bepin Babu noticed that with
every passing hour, the previous day’s encounter was
occupying more and more of his mind. If the man knew
so much about Bepin Babu, how could he make such a
mistake about the Ranchi trip?
Just before lunch Bepin Babu decided to ring up
Dinesh Mukerji. It was better to settle the question over
the phone; at least the embarrassment on his face
wouldn’t show.
Two-Three-Five-Six-One-Six. Bepin Babu dialled
the number.
“Hallo.”
“Is that Dinesh? This is Bepin here.”
“Well, well — what’s the news?”
“I just wanted to find out if you recalled an incident
which took place in’ 58.”

For a minute there was silence. Bepin Babu could
feel that his heartbeat had gone up. He was sweating
a little.
“Hallo.”
“Yes.”
“I've got it. I’d been out twice.”
“Where?”
“Once in February — nearby — to Krishnanagar to a

all. But what’s all this sleuthing about?”
“No. I just wanted to — anyway, thanks.”

his head with his hands. He felt his head swimming. A
chill seemed to spread over his body. There were
sandwiches in his tiffin box, but he didn’t eat them. He
had lost his appetite.

After lunch-time, Bepin Babu realised that he couldn’t
possibly carry on sitting at his desk and working. This
had never happened in the twenty-five years he had
been with the firm. He had a reputation for being a
64 Honeydew
2019-2020tireless, conscientious worker. But today his head was
in a whirl.
Back home at two-thirty, Bepin Babu lay down in
bed and tried to gather his wits together. He knew that
it was possible to lose one’s memory through an injury
in the head, but he didn’t know of a single instance of
someone remembering everything except one particular
incident — and a fairly recent and significant one at
that. He had always wanted to go to Ranchi; to have
gone there, done things, and not to remember was
something utterly impossible.
At seven thirty, Bepin Babu’s servant came and
announced, “Chuni Babu, sir. Says it’s very important.”
Bepin Babu knew what Chuni had come for. Chunilal
had been at school with him. He’d been having a rough
time lately and had been coming to see him about a
job. Bepin Babu knew it was not possible to do anything
for him and, in fact, told him so. But Chuni kept turning
up like a bad penny.
Bepin Babu sent word that not only was it not
possible for him to see Chuni now, but not in several
weeks.
But as soon as the servant stepped out of the room,
it struck Bepin Babu that Chuni might remember
something about the ’58 trip. There was no harm in
asking him.
Bepin Babu hurried down the stairs and into the
living room. Chuni was about to leave, but seeing Bepin
Babu appear, he turned round hopefully.
Bepin Babu didn’t beat about the bush.
“Listen, Chuni - I want to ask you something. You
have a good memory, and you've been seeing me off
and on for a long time. Just throw your mind back and
tell me - did I go to Ranchi in ’58?”
Chuni said, “’58? It must have been ’58. Or was it
’59?”

“You’re sure that I did go to Ranchi?”
Chuni’s look of amazement was not unmixed with
worry.
“D’ you mean you have doubts about having gone at
all?”
“Did I go? Do you remember clearly?”
Chuni sat down on the sofa, fixed Bepin Babu with
a long, hard stare and said, “Bepin, have you taken to
drugs or something? As far as I know, you had a clean
record where such things were concerned. I know that
old friendships don’t mean much to you, but at least
you had a good memory. You can’t really mean that
you’ve forgotten about the Ranchi trip?”
Bepin Babu had to turn away from Chuni’s
incredulous stare.
“Do you remember what my last job was?” asked
Chunilal.
“Of course. You worked in a travel agency.”
“You remember that and you don’t remember that it
was I who fixed up your railway booking for Ranchi? I
went to the station to see you off; one of the fans in
your compartment was not working — I got an electrician
to fix it. Have you forgotten everything? Whatever is the
matter with you? You don’t look too well, you know.”
Bepin Babu sighed and shook his head.
“I’ve been working too hard,” he said at last. “That
must be the reason. Must see about consulting a
specialist.”
Doubtless it was Bepin’s condition which made
Chunilal leave without mentioning anything about a job.
Paresh Chanda was a young physician with a pair of
bright eyes and a sharp nose. He became thoughtful
when he heard about Bepin Babu’s symptoms. “Look,
Dr Chanda,” said Bepin Babu desperately, “You must
cure me of this horrible illness. I can’t tell you how it's
affecting my work.”
6 6 Honeydew
2019-2020Dr Chanda shook his head.
“You know what, Mr Choudhury,” he said. “I’ve never
had to deal with a case such as yours. Frankly, this is
quite outside my field of experience. But I have one
suggestion. I don’t know if it’ll work, but it’s worth a
try. It can do no harm.”
Bepin Babu leaned forward anxiously.
“As far as I can make out,” said Dr Chanda, “And I
think you’re of the same opinion — you must have been
to Ranchi, but due to some unknown reason, the entire
episode has slipped out of your mind. What I suggest is
that you go to Ranchi once again. The sight of the place
may remind you of your trip. This is not impossible.
More than that I cannot do at the moment. I’m
prescribing a nerve tonic and a tranquilliser. Sleep is
essential, or the symptoms will get more pronounced.”
Bepin Babu felt somewhat better the next morning.
After breakfast, he rang up his office, gave some
instructions and then procured a first class ticket for
Ranchi for the same evening.

Getting off the train at Ranchi next morning, he realised
at once that he had never been there before.
He came out of the station, took a taxi and drove
around the town for a while. He realised that the streets,
the buildings, the hotels, the bazaars, the Morabadi Hill
— with none of these had he the slightest acquaintance.
Would a trip to the Hudroo Falls help? He didn't believe
so, but, at the same time, he didn't wish to leave with the
feeling that he hadn’t tried enough. So he arranged for a
car and left for Hudroo in the afternoon.

At five o’clock the same afternoon in Hudroo, two
Gujarati gentlemen from a group of picnickers discovered
Bepin Babu lying unconscious beside a boulder. When
he came round, the first thing Bepin Babu said was,
“I’m finished. There’s no hope left.”
Next morning, Bepin Babu was back in Calcutta. He
realised that there was truly no hope for him. Soon he
would lose everything: his will to work, his confidence,
his ability, his balance of mind. Was he going to end up
in the asylum at...? Bepin Babu couldn’t think any more.
Back home, he rang up Dr Chanda and asked him to
come over. Then, after a shower, he got into bed with an
ice bag clamped on his head. Just then the servant brought
him a letter which someone had left in the letter box.
A greenish envelope with his name in red ink on it.
Above the name it said ‘Urgent and Confidential’. In
spite of his condition, Bepin Babu had a feeling that he
ought to go through the letter. He tore open the envelope
and took out the letter. This is what he read —

2019-2020A bargain is an agreement in which both parties promise to do
something for each other. Someone is looking for work, waiting
to be hired. He strikes a bargain but thinks it worthless. He
tries twice again but doesn't like either. Finally, in the last
bargain, when he is hired for nothing whatever, he is happy as
never before. What is the bargain, and why is it the best?
“Come and hire me,” I cried, while in the morning
I was walking on the stone-paved road.
Sword in hand the King came in his chariot.
He held my hand and said, “I will hire you with
my power,”
But his power counted for naught, and he went away in
his chariot.
In the heat of the mid-day the houses stood with
shut doors.
I wandered along the crooked lane.
An old man came out with his bag of gold.
He pondered and said, “I will hire you with my money.”
He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.
2019-2020It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.
The fair maid came out and said, “I will hire you with
a smile.”
Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went
back alone into the dark.
The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke
waywardly.
A child sat playing with shells.
He raised his head and seemed to know me and said,
“I hire you with nothing.”
From henceforward that bargain struck in child’s play
made me a free man.

2019-2020Before you read
Major H.P.S. Ahluwalia was a member of the first
successful Indian expedition to Mount Everest in 1965.
How did he feel when he stood on the highest point in
the world? Let us hear his story in his words —
climbing the summit and, then, the more difficult task
of climbing the summit within.
Of all the emotions which surged through me as I stood
on the summit of Everest, looking over miles of
panorama below us, the dominant one I think was
humility. The physical in me seemed to say, ‘Thank
God, it’s all over!” However, instead of being jubilant,
there was a tinge of sadness. Was it because I had already
done the ‘ultimate’ in climbing and there would be
nothing higher to climb and all roads hereafter would
lead down?
By climbing the summit of Everest you are
overwhelmed by a deep sense of joy and thankfulness.
It is a joy which lasts a lifetime. The experience changes
you completely. The man who has been to the mountains
is never the same again.
As I look back at life after climbing Everest I cannot
help remarking about the other summit — the summit
of the mind — no less formidable and no easier to climb.

Even when getting down from the summit, once the
physical exhaustion had gone, I began asking myself
the question why I had climbed Everest. Why did the
act of reaching the summit have such a hold on my
imagination? It was already a thing of the past,
something done yesterday. With every passing day, it
would become more remote. A nd then what would
remain? Would my memories fade slowly away?
A ll these thoughts led me to question myself as
to why people climb mountains. It is not easy to
answer the question. The simplest answer would
be, as others have said, “Because it is there.” It
presents great difficulties. Man takes delight in
overcoming obstacles. The obstacles in climbing a
mountain are physical. A climb to a summit means
endurance, persistence and will power. The
demonstration of these physical qualities is no doubt
exhilarating, as it was for me also.
I have a more personal answer to the question. From
my childhood I have been attracted by mountains. I
had been miserable, lost, when away from mountains,
in the plains. Mountains are nature at its best. Their
beauty and majesty pose a great challenge, and like
many, I believe that mountains are a means of
communion with God.
Once having granted this, the question remains: Why
Everest? Because it is the highest, the mightiest and
has defied many previous attempts. It takes the last
ounce of one’s energy. It is a brutal struggle with rock
and ice. Once taken up, it cannot be given up halfway
even when one’s life is at stake. The passage back is as
difficult as the passage onwards. And then, when the
summit is climbed, there is the exhilaration, the joy of
having done something, the sense of a battle fought
and won. There is a feeling of victory and of happiness.
Glimpsing a peak in the distance, I get transported
to another world. I experience a change within myself
Honeydew
2019-2020which can only be called mystical. By its beauty,
aloofness, might, ruggedness, and the dif ficulties
encountered on the way, the peak draws me to it — as
Everest did. It is a challenge that is difficult to resist.
Looking back I find that I have not
yet fully explained why I climbed
Everest. It is like answering a question
why you breathe. Why do you help your
neighbour? Why do you want to do good
acts? There is no final answer possible.
And then there is the fact that Everest
is not just a physical climb. The man who
has been to the mountain-top becomes
conscious in a special manner of his own
smallness in this large universe.
The physical conquest of a mountain
is only one part of the achievement.
There is more to it than that. It is
followed by a sense of fulfilment. There
is the satisfaction of a deep urge to rise
above one’s surroundings. It is the
eternal love for adventure in man. The experience is not
merely physical. It is emotional. It is spiritual.
Consider a typical climb, towards the summit on the
last heights. You are sharing a rope with another
climber. You firm in. He cuts the steps in the hard ice.
Then he belays and you inch your way up. The climb is
grim. You strain every nerve as you take every step.
Famous climbers have left records of the help given by
others. They have also recorded how they needed just
that help. Else they might have given up. Breathing is
difficult. You curse yourself for having let yourself in for
this. You wonder why you ever undertook the ascent.
There are moments when you feel like going back. It
would be sheer relief to go down, instead of up. But
almost at once you snap out of that mood. There is
something in you that does not let you give up the

struggle. And you go on. Your companion keeps up with
you. Just another fifty feet. Or a hundred, maybe. You
ask yourself: Is there no end? You look at your
companion and he looks at you. You draw inspiration
from each other. And then, without first being aware of
it, you are at the summit.
Looking round from the summit you tell yourself
that it was worthwhile. Other silvery peaks appear
through the clouds. If you are lucky the sun may be on
them. The surrounding peaks look like a jewelled
necklace around the neck of your summit. Below, you
see vast valleys sloping into the distance. It is an
ennobling, enriching experience to just look down from
the summit of a mountain. You bow down and make
your obeisance to whichever God you worship.
I left on Everest a picture of Guru Nanak. Rawat left
a picture of Goddess Durga. Phu Dorji left a relic of the
Buddha. Edmund Hillary had buried a cross under a
cairn (a heap of rocks and stones) in the snow. These
are not symbols of conquest but of reverence.
The experience of having
climbed to the summit
changes you completely.
There is another summit.
It is within yourself. It is in
your own mind. Each man
carries within himself his
own mountain peak. He
must climb it to reach to a
fuller knowledge of himself.
It is fearful, and unscalable.
It cannot be climbed by

within. The effects of both the climbs are the same.
Whether the mountain you climb is physical or
emotional and spiritual, the climb will certainly change
you. It teaches you much about the world and about
yourself.
I venture to think that my experience as an Everester
has provided me with the inspiration to face life’s ordeals
resolutely. Climbing the mountain was a worthwhile
experience. The conquest of the internal summit is
equally worthwhile. The internal summits are, perhaps,
higher than Everest.

Under a cruel eye outworn,

In sighing and dismay.

A nd spend many an anxious hour.
Nor in my book can I take delight,
Nor sit in learning’s bower,
Worn thro’ with the dreary shower.

Sit in a cage and sing.
How can a child when fears annoy,
But droop his tender wing,
And forget his youthful spring.

When I was young, I went to school
With pencil and footrule

And sat on a tall stool
At learning’s gate.
When I was older, the gate swung wide;
Clever and keen-eyed
In I pressed,
But found in the mind’s pride
No peace, no rest.

To cattle and barrow,
Field and plough:
To keep to the one furrow,
As I do now?

“You are smarter than boys of your age.”

Jody gave himself over to thoughts of the fawn. They
passed the abandoned clearing.
He said, “Cut to the north, Mill-wheel. It was up here
that Pa got bitten by the snake and killed the doe and I
saw the fawn.”
Suddenly Jody was unwilling to have Mill-wheel with
him. If the fawn was dead, or could not be found, he
could not have his disappointment seen. And if the fawn
was there, the meeting would be so lovely and so secret
that he could not endure to share it.
He said, “It’s not far now, but the scrub is very thick
for a horse. I can make it on foot.”
“But I’m afraid to leave you, boy. Suppose you got
lost or got bitten by the snake, too?”
“I’ll take care. It might take me a long time to find
the fawn, if he’s wandered. Leave me off right here.”
“All right, but you take it easy now. You know north
here, and east?”
“There, and there. That tall pine makes a bearing.”
“So long.”
“So long, Mill-wheel. I’m obliged.”
He waited for the sound of the hooves to end, then
cut to the right. The scrub was still. Only his own
crackling of twigs sounded across the silence. He

Then a buzzard rose in front of him and flapped into

Buzzards sat in a circle around the carcass of the doe.
They turned their heads on their long scrawny necks
and hissed at him. He threw his bough at them and
they flew into an adjacent tree. The sand showed large
cat prints but the big cats killed fresh, and they had left
the doe to the carrion birds.
He parted the grass at the place where he had seen
the fawn. It did not seem possible that it was only
yesterday. The fawn was not there. He circled the
clearing. There was no sound, no sign. The buzzards
clacked their wings, impatient to return to their
business. He returned to the spot where the fawn had
emerged and dropped on all fours, studying the sand
for the small hoof prints. The night’s rain had washed
away all tracks except those of cat and buzzards.

Movement directly in front of him startled him so that
he tumbled backward. The fawn lifted its face to his. It
turned its head with a wide, wondering motion and
shook him through with the stare of its liquid eyes. It
was quivering. It made no effort to rise or run. Jody
could not trust himself to move.
He whispered, “It’s me.”
The fawn lifted its nose, scenting him. He reached
out one hand and laid it on the soft neck. The touch
made him delirious. He moved forward on all fours until
he was close beside it. He put his arms around its body.
A light convulsion passed over it but it did not stir.

They were surprisingly long and he had to hoist the

He was afraid that it might kick and bleat at sight
and smell of its mother. He skirted the clearing and
pushed his way into the thicket. It was difficult to fight
through with his burden. The fawn’s legs caught in the
bushes and he could not lift his own with freedom. He
tried to shield its face from prickling vines. Its head
bobbed with his stride. His heart thumped with the
marvel of its acceptance of him. He reached the trail
and walked as fast as he could until he came to the
intersection with the road home. He stopped to rest and
set the fawn down on its dangling legs. It wavered on
them. It looked at him and bleated.
He said, enchanted, “I’ll carry you after I get my breath.”
He remembered his father saying that a fawn would
follow if it had first been carried. He started away slowly.
The fawn stared after him. He came back to it and

and romp with it, to call to it to come to him. He dared
not alarm it. He picked it up and carried it in front of
him over his two arms. It seemed to him that he walked
without effort.
His arms began to ache and he was forced to stop
again. When he walked on, the fawn followed him at
once. He allowed it to walk a little distance, then picked
it up again. The distance home was nothing. He could
have walked all day and into the night, carrying it and
watching it follow. He was wet with sweat but a light
breeze blew through the June morning, cooling him.
The sky was as clear as spring water in a blue china
cup. He came to the clearing. It was fresh and green
after the night’s rain. He fumbled with the latch and
was finally obliged to set down the fawn to manage it.
Then, he had an idea — he would walk into the house,
into Penny’s bedroom, with the fawn walking behind
him. But at the steps, the fawn balked and refused to
climb them. He picked it up and went to his father.
Penny lay with closed eyes.
Jody called, “Pa! Look!”
Penny turned his head. Jody stood beside him, the
fawn clutched hard against him. It seemed to Penny
that the boy’s eyes were as bright as the fawn’s. He
said, “I’m glad you found him.”
Jody then went to the kitchen. The fawn wobbled
after him. A pan of morning’s milk stood in the kitchen
safe. The cream had risen on it. He skimmed the cream
into a jug. He poured milk into a small gourd. He held
it out to the fawn. It butted it suddenly, smelling the
milk. He saved it precariously from spilling over the
floor. It could make nothing of the milk in the gourd.
He dipped his fingers in the milk and thrust them
into the fawn’s soft wet mouth. It sucked greedily. When
he withdrew them, it bleated frantically and butted him.
He dipped his fingers again and as the fawn sucked, he
lowered them slowly into the milk. The fawn blew and
Honeydew
2019-2020sucked and snorted. It stamped its small hoofs
impatiently. As long as he held his fingers below
the level of the milk, the fawn was content.
It closed its eyes dreamily. It was
ecstasy to feel its tongue
against his hand. Its small tail
flicked back and forth. The last
of the milk vanished in a swirl
of foam and gurgling.

95Before you read
This is the story of a meeting between two
extraordinary people, both of them ‘disabled’, or
‘differently abled’ as we now say. Stephen Hawking
is one of the greatest scientists of our time. He suffers
from a form of paralysis that confines him to a
wheelchair, and allows him to ‘speak’ only by punching
buttons on a computer, which speaks for him in a
machine-like voice. Firdaus Kanga is a writer and
journalist who lives and works in Mumbai. Kanga was
born with ‘brittle bones’ that tended to break easily
when he was a child. Like Hawking, Kanga moves
around in a wheelchair.
The two great men exchange thoughts on what it
means to live life in a wheelchair, and on how the so
called ‘normal’ people react to the disabled.

astrophysics

stars, planets,
etc.
Cambridge was my metaphor for England, and it was
strange that when I left it had become altogether something
else, because I had met Stephen Hawking there.
It was on a walking tour through Cambridge that
the guide mentioned Stephen Hawking, ‘poor man, who
is quite disabled now, though he is a worthy successor
to Issac Newton, whose Chair he has at the university.’
And I started, because I had quite forgotten that this
most brilliant and completely paralysed astrophysicist,
2019-2020the author of A Brief History of Time, one of
the biggest best-sellers ever, lived here.
When the walking tour was done, I rushed
to a phone booth and, almost tearing the cord
so it could reach me outside, phoned Stephen
Hawking’s house. There was his assistant on
the line and I told him I had come in a
wheelchair from India (perhaps he thought I
had propelled myself all the way) to write
about my travels in Britain. I had to see
Professor Hawking — even ten minutes would
do. “Half an hour,“ he said. “From three-thirty
to four.”
A nd suddenly I felt weak all over. Growing
up disabled, you get fed up with people asking you to
be brave, as if you have a courage account on which
you are too lazy to draw a cheque. The only thing
that makes you stronger is seeing somebody like you,
achieving something huge. Then you know how much
is possible and you reach out further than you ever
thought you could.
“I haven’t been brave,” said his disembodied
computer-voice, the next afternoon. “I’ve had no choice.”
Surely, I wanted to say, living creatively with the
reality of his disintegrating body was a choice? But I
kept quiet, because I felt guilty every time I spoke to
him, forcing him to respond. There he was, tapping at
the little switch in his hand, trying to find the words on
his computer with the only bit of movement left to him,
his long, pale fingers. Every so often, his eyes would
shut in frustrated exhaustion. And sitting opposite him
I could feel his anguish, the mind buoyant with thoughts
that came out in frozen phrases and sentences stiff as
corpses.
“A lot of people seem to think that disabled people
are chronically unhappy,” I said. “I know that’s not true
myself. Are you often laughing inside?”

About three minutes later, he responded, “I find it
amusing when people patronise me.”
“And do you find it annoying when someone like me
comes and disturbs you in your work?”
The answer flashed. “Yes.” Then he smiled his one-
way smile and I knew, without being sentimental or
silly, that I was looking at one of the most beautiful
men in the world.
A first glimpse of him is shocking, because he is like a
still photograph — as if all those pictures of him in
magazines and newspapers have turned three-dimensional.
Then you see the head twisted sideways into a slump,
the torso shrunk inside the pale blue shirt, the wasted
legs; you look at his eyes which can speak, still, and
they are saying something huge and urgent — it is hard
to tell what. But you are shaken because you have seen
something you never thought could be seen.
Before you, like a lantern whose walls are worn so
thin you glimpse only the light inside, is the
incandescence of a man. The body, almost irrelevant,
exists only like a case made of shadows. So that I, no
believer in eternal souls, know that this is what each of
us is; everything else an accessory.
“What do you think is the best thing about being
disabled?” I had asked him earlier.
“I don’t think there is anything good about being disabled.”
“I think,” I said, “you do discover how much kindness
there is in the world.”
“Yes,” he said; it was a disadvantage of his voice
synthesiser that it could convey no inflection, no shades
or tone. And I could not tell how enthusiastically he
agreed with me.
Every time I shifted in my chair or turned my wrist
to watch the time — I wanted to make every one of our
thirty minutes count — I felt a huge relief and
exhilaration in the possibilities of my body. How little it
mattered then that I would never walk, or even stand.
Honeydew
2019-2020I told him how he had been an inspiration beyond
cliche´ for me, and, surely, for others — did that thought
help him?
“No,” he said; and I thought how foolish I was to ask.
When your body is a claustrophobic room and the walls
are growing narrower day by day, it doesn’t do much
good to know that there are people outside smiling with
admiration to see you breathing still.
“Is there any advice you can give disabled people,
something that might help make life better?”
“They should concentrate on what they are good at; I
think things like the disabled Olympics are a waste of time.”
“I know what you mean.” I remembered the years I’d
spent trying to play a Spanish guitar considerably larger
than I was; and how gleefully I had unstringed it one night.
The half-hour was up. “I think I’ve annoyed you
enough,” I said, grinning. “Thank you for...”
“Stay.” I waited. “Have some tea. I can show you the garden.”
The garden was as big as a park, but Stephen
Hawking covered every inch, rumbling along in his
motorised wheelchair while I dodged to keep
out of the way. We couldn’t talk very much;
the sun made him silent, the letters on his
screen disappearing in the glare.
An hour later, we were ready to leave. I didn’t
know what to do. I could not kiss him or cry. I
touched his shoulder and wheeled out into the
summer evening. I looked back; and I knew he
was waving, though he wasn’t. Watching him,
an embodiment of my bravest self, the one I
was moving towards, the one I had believed in
for so many years, alone, I knew that my
journey was over. For now.

The Great Stone Face – I and II
A classic piece of American fiction juxtaposing mellowness of
humanism with magnificence of art. Ernest, an unschooled
dweller of the valley, has close affinity with the ‘Stone Face’ atop
the hills beyond. Who resembles the splendid Stone Face — not
someone for all his wealth, not someone else for all his heroic
deeds, and not someone else yet again for his poetry and sublime
ideas. It is none other than Ernest who personifies a rare blend of
basic simplicity, practical wisdom and deep love for humanity.
The original story has been heavily abridged. Simplification
has been avoided in the interest of authenticity. You may like
to read the unabridged text for pleasure and edification.
Design three or four while-reading comprehension questions
for each section of the text (parts I and II)
The writing activity (Part-II : IV) is for further practice in language
analysis. Rearranging phrases to construct sentences and then
rearranging sentences to construct a paragraph will provide
many opportunities for thinking about cohesion and coherence.
Activities 1 and 2 under working with language (Part I) on
adding -ness and -ity for forming nouns and adding -ly to
adjectives for forming adverbs should be completed in three
or four sessions. One period may be devoted to each item

June 24
The first day of monsoon mist. And it’s strange how all
the birds fall silent as the mist comes climbing up the
hill. Perhaps that’s what makes the mist so melancholy;
not only does it conceal the hills, it blankets them in
silence too. Only an hour ago the trees were ringing
with birdsong. And now the forest is deathly still as
though it were midnight.
Through the mist Bijju is calling to his sister. I can
hear him running about on the hillside but I cannot
see him.

Some genuine early-
monsoon rain, warm
and humid, and not
that cold high-altitude
stuff we’ve been having
all year. The plants
seem to know it too,
and the first cobra lily
rears its head from the
ferns as I walk up to the
bank and post office.
The mist affords a
certain privacy.
A school boy asked
me to describe the hill
station and valley in
one sentence, and all I could say was: “A paradise that
might have been.”
June 27
The rains have heralded the arrival of some seasonal
visitors—a leopard, and several thousand leeches.
Yesterday afternoon the leopard lifted a dog from near
the servants’ quarter below the school. In the evening it
attacked one of Bijju’s cows but fled at the approach of
Bijju’s mother, who came screaming imprecations.
As for the leeches, I shall soon get used to a little
bloodletting every day.
Other new arrivals are the scarlet minivets (the
females are yellow), flitting silently among the leaves
like brilliant jewels. No matter how leafy the trees, these
brightly coloured birds cannot conceal themselves,
although, by remaining absolutely silent, they
sometimes contrive to go unnoticed. Along come a pair
of drongos, unnecessarily aggressive, chasing the
minivets away.

All night the rain has been drumming on the

thunder, just the steady swish of a tropical downpour.
It helps me to lie awake; at the same time, it doesn’t
keep me from sleeping.
It is a good sound to read by — the rain outside, the

It is the last day of August,
and the lush monsoon
growth has reached its
peak. The seeds of the
cobra lily are turning red,
signifying that the rains are coming to an end.
In a few days the ferns will start turning yellow, but
right now they are still firm, green and upright. Ground
orchids, mauve lady’s slipper and the white butterfly
orchids put on a fashion display on the grassy slopes of
Landour. Wild dahlias, red, yellow and magenta, rear
their heads from the rocky crevices where they have
taken hold.
Snakes and rodents, flooded out of their holes and
burrows, take shelter in roofs, attics and godowns. A
shrew, weak of eyesight, blunders about the rooms,
much to the amusement of the children.

In the hushed silence of the house
when I am quite alone, and my

has gone, it is very lonely, very quiet,
as I sit in a liquid silence, a silence
within,
surrounded by the rhythm of rain,
the steady drift
of water on leaves, on lemons, on roof,
drumming on drenched dahlias and

while the mist holds the house in a

117Unlike The Ant and the Cricket (page 21), which tells a story, this
is a nature poem. In it, the grasshopper and cricket do not appear
as characters in a story. Rather, they act as symbols, each
suggesting something else. Read the poem and notice how ‘the
poetry of earth’ keeps on through summer and winter in a never-
ending song. Who sings the song?
The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead,
That is the grasshopper’s — he takes the lead
In summer luxury — he has never done
With his delights, for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the stone there shrills
The cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost;
The grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.

119Before you read
Seen from a distance, hilltops and huge rocks seem to
assume various shapes. They may resemble an animal
or a human figure. People attribute stories to these
shapes. Some stories come true; others don’t.
The Great Stone Face is one such shape that reminds
the inhabitants of the valley of a prophecy. What was
it? Did it come true?
One afternoon, when the sun was going down, a mother
and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking
about the Great Stone Face. They had only to lift their
eyes and there it was, plain to be seen, though miles
away, with the sunshine brightening all its features.
2019-2020And what was the Great Stone Face?
The Great Stone Face was a work of nature, formed on
the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense
rocks, which had been thrown together so that, when
viewed at a proper distance, they resembled the features
of a human face. If the spectator approached too near, he
lost the outline of the enormous face and could see only a
heap of gigantic rocks, piled one upon another. But seen
from a distance, the clouds clustering about it, the Great
Stone Face seemed positively to be alive. It was the belief
of many people that the valley owed much of its fertility to
the benign face that was continually beaming over it.
A mother and her little boy, as we said earlier, sat at
the door of their cottage, gazing at the Great Stone Face
and talking about it. The child’s name was Ernest.
“Mother,” said he, while the Great Face smiled on
him, “I wish that it could speak, for it looks so very
kindly that its voice must indeed be pleasant. If I
ever see a man with such a face, I should love him
very much.”
“If an old prophecy should come to pass,” answered
his mother, “we may see a man some time, with exactly
such a face as that.”
“What prophecy
do you mean, dear
Mother?” eagerly
inquired
Ernest.
“Please tell me about
it.”
So his mother told
him a story that her
own mother had told
her, when she herself
was younger than
little Ernest; that, at
some future day, a
child should be born

near here, who was destined to become the greatest and
noblest person of his time and whose face, in manhood,
should bear an exact resemblance to the Great Stone
Face. Many still had faith in this old prophecy. But
others took it to be nothing but idle talk. At all events
the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared.
“O, Mother,” cried Ernest, clapping his hands above
his head, “I do hope that I shall live to see him!”
His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful
woman. It was proper, she thought, not to discourage
the fanciful hopes of her little boy. So she said to him,
“Perhaps you may.”
And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother
told him. It was always in his mind whenever he looked
upon the Great Stone Face. He spent his childhood in
the log-cottage where he was born, was dutiful to his
mother and helpful to her in many things, assisting
her much with his little hands, and more with his loving
heart. In this manner, from a happy yet often pensive
child he grew up to be a mild and quiet youth.
Ernest had had no teacher, but the Great Stone Face
became one to him. When the work of the day was over,
he would gaze at it for hours, until he began to imagine
that those vast features recognised him, and gave him a
smile of kindness and encouragement.
About this time there went a rumour throughout
the valley that the great man, who was to bear a
resemblance to the Great Stone Face, had appeared at
last. It seems that, many years before, a young man
had left the valley and settled at a distant seaport.
Gathergold, which was his name, had set up as a
shopkeeper and, being sharp in business matters, had
become so very rich that it would have taken him a
hundred years only to count his wealth. In time he
thought of his native valley, and decided to go back
there, and end his days where he had been born.
122 Honeydew
2019-2020Ernest had been deeply stirred by the idea that the
great man, the noble man, the man of prophecy, after
so many ages of delay, was at length to be seen in his
native valley. While the boy was still gazing up the valley
one day and imagining that the Great Stone Face
returned his gaze, the noise of wheels was heard, and a
crowd of people cried. “Here comes the great
Mr Gathergold.”
A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the
turn of the road. Within it, thrust partly out of the window
appeared the face of an old man with yellow skin.
“The very image of the Great Stone Face!” shouted
the people. “Sure enough, the old prophecy is true. Here
we have the great man, at last!”
And, what greatly puzzled Ernest, they seemed
actually to believe that here was the likeness which they
spoke of. He turned away sadly from the wrinkled
shrewdness of that unpleasant face, and gazed up the
valley, where the Stone Face seemed to say: He will come!
Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!

The years went on, and Ernest grew to be a young
man. He attracted little notice from the inhabitants of
the valley. They saw nothing remarkable in his way of
life, except that, when the labour of the day was over,
he still loved to gaze upon the Great Stone Face. Their
idea was that this was a folly, but pardonable, because
Ernest was industrious, kind and neighbourly. They
did not know that the Great Stone Face had become a
teacher to him, and that the sentiment which was
expressed in it would enlarge the young man's heart,
and fill it with deeper sympathies than other hearts.
They did not know that from this would come a better
wisdom than could be learnt from books. Neither did
Ernest know that the thoughts which came to him so

naturally, in the fields and at the fireside, were of a
higher tone than those which all men shared with him.
A simple soul — simple as when his mother first told
him the old story — he beheld the marvellous face
looking down the valley, and still wondered, why its
human likeness was so long in coming.
By this time poor Mr Gathergold was dead and
buried. His wealth, which was the body and spirit of
his existence, had disappeared before his death. Since
the melting away of his gold, it had been generally
agreed that there was no great likeness, after all,
between the ruined merchant and the majestic face
upon the mountain.
It so happened that another son of the valley had
become a soldier many years before. After a great deal of
hard fighting, he was now a famous commander. He was
known on the battlefield by the name of Blood-and-
Thunder. Old and tired now, he had lately expressed a
desire to return to his native valley. The inhabitants, his
old neighbours and their grown up children, prepared to
welcome the renowned commander. It was being said that
at last the likeness of the Great Stone Face had actually
appeared. Great, therefore, was the excitement
throughout the valley, and many people who had never
once thought of glancing at the Great Stone Face now
spent much time in gazing at it, for the sake of knowing
exactly how General Blood-and-Thunder looked.
On the day of the general’s arrival, Ernest and all
the other people of the valley left their work, and
proceeded to the spot where a great banquet had been
prepared. Soldiers stood on guard, flags waved and the
crowd roared. Ernest was standing too far back to see
Blood-and-Thunder’s face. However, he could hear
several voices.
“It’s the same face, exactly!” cried one man, dancing
for joy.
Honeydew
2019-2020“Wonderfully like
it, that’s a fact!” replied
another.
“And why not?”
cried a third; “he’s the
greatest man of this or
any other age, beyond
a doubt.”
Ernest at last could
see the general’s face;
and in the same
glance, to the side, he
could also see the
Great Stone Face. If
there was such a
likeness as the crowd
proclaimed, Ernest could not recognise it.

127Before you read
Many years passed. Ernest was now a man of middle
age. To his neighbours, who never suspected that he
was anything more than an ordinary and familiar face,
he was only a humble and hardworking, though
thoughtful, person.
But what about the old prophecy? Was it ever fulfilled?
Let us read and find out.
furrows:
deep lines
The years hurried on, and brought white hairs upon
the head of Ernest, and made wrinkles across his
forehead and furrows in his cheeks. He was an old man.
But not in vain had he grown old; more numerous than
the white hairs on his head were the wise thoughts in
2019-2020his mind. And Ernest had ceased to be obscure.
Unsought for, undesired, had come the fame which so
many seek. He had become famous beyond the limits of
the valley. College professors, and even the active men
of cities, came from far to see and converse with Ernest,
and he received them with gentle sincerity, and spoke
freely with them of whatever came uppermost, or lay
deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked
together, his face would brighten, unawares, and shine
upon them, as with a mild evening light.
While Ernest had been growing old, God had granted
a new poet to this earth. He, too, was a native of the
valley, but had spent the greater part of his life in distant
cities, pouring out his sweet music everywhere. Neither
was the Great Stone Face forgotten, for the poet had
celebrated it in a poem. The songs of this poet found
their way to Ernest. He read them after his customary
toil, seated on the bench before his cottage door. As he
read he lifted his eyes to the mountain.
“O Great Stone Face,” he said, “is not this man worthy
to be your likeness?”
The face seemed to smile, but did not answer.
Now it happened that the poet, though he lived so
far away, had not only heard of Ernest but had thought
much about his character and wished to meet this man
whose wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble
simplicity of his life. One summer day, therefore, he
arrived at Ernest’s door, where he found the good old
man holding a book in his hand, which he read and,
then, with a finger between the leaves, looked lovingly
at the Great Stone Face.
“Good evening,” said the poet. “Can you give a
traveller a night’s shelter?”
“Gladly,” answered Ernest; and then he added,
smiling, “I think I never saw the Great Stone Face look
so hospitably at a stranger.”

The poet sat down beside him, and he and Ernest
talked together. Never before had the poet talked with a
man like Ernest, so wise, and gentle, and kind. Ernest,
on the other hand, was moved by the living images flung
out of the poet’s mind.
As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the
Great Stone Face was bending forward to listen too. He
gazed into the poet’s eyes.
“Who are you, my gifted guest?” he asked.
The poet laid his finger on the book that Ernest had
been reading.
“You have read these poems,” said he. “You know
me, then, for I wrote them.”
Again and again, Ernest examined the poet’s
features; he turned towards the Great Stone Face then
back. He shook his head and sighed.
“Why are you sad?” inquired the poet.
“Because,” replied Ernest, “all through life I have
awaited the fulfillment of a prophecy, and when I read
these poems, I hoped that it might be fulfilled in you.”
“You hoped,” answered the poet, faintly smiling, “to
find in me the likeness of the Great Stone Face. I am
not worthy to be its likeness.”
2019-2020“And why not?” asked Ernest. He pointed to the book.
“Are not those thoughts worthy?”
“You can hear in them the distant voice of a heavenly
song. But my life, dear Ernest, has not corresponded
with my thoughts. I have had grand dreams, but they
have been only dreams. Sometimes I lack faith in my
own thoughts. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and
true, should you hope to find me in the face of the
mountain?”
The poet spoke sadly and his eyes were wet with tears.
So, too, were those of Ernest.
At the hour of sunset, as had long been his custom,
Ernest was to speak to a group of neighbours in the
open air. Together he and the poet went to the meeting
place, arm in arm. From there could be seen the Great
Stone Face.
Ernest threw a look of familiar kindness around upon
his audience. He began to speak to the people what was
in his heart and mind. His words had power, because
they agreed with his thoughts; and his thoughts had
reality and depth, because they harmonised with the
life which he had always lived. It was not mere breath
that the preacher uttered; they were the words of life. A
life of good deeds and selfless love was melted into them.
The poet, as he listened, felt that the life and character
of Ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had
ever written. His eyes filled with tears and he said to
himself that never was there so worthy a sage as that
mild, sweet, thoughtful face, with the glory of white hair
diffused about it.
At a distance, but clearly to be seen, high up in the
golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone
Face, with white mists around it, like the white hairs
around the brow of Ernest. At that moment, Ernest’s
face took on an expression so grand that the poet was
moved to throw his arms up and shout. “Behold! Behold!
Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone Face!”

131Then all the people looked, and saw that what the
poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled. But
Ernest, having finished what he had to say, took the
poet’s arm, and walked slowly homeward, still hoping
that some wiser and better man than himself would
by and by appear, bearing a resemblance to the Great
Stone Face.
